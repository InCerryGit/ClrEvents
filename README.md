# ClrEvents
Source code based on TraceEvent to listen to CLR events at runtime.

## Introduction
Most of the code is detailed in the blog series related to CLR events:

## Source Code
The `DebuggingExtensions` Visual Studio 2017 solution contains four projects:

1. `ClrCounters`:.NET Standard assembly to easily listen to CLR events with TraceEvent. 

2. `ConsoleListener`: Demo console application that uses 'ClrCounters' to display CLR details of a running application.

3. `NaiveListener`: Demo console application that displays raw CLR events with TraceEvent.

4. `Simulator`: Console application used to simulate interesting behaviours (contention, exceptions, allocations, thread pool usage).



These projects depends on Nuget package:

- [TraceEvent](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent/): C# library to listen to CLR events.
Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/tree/master/src/TraceEvent).
